## Don't just learn to code, learn to create

No amount of tutorials and books are gonna help if you don't build something of yourself. The amount of learning you do when doing your own projects, getting stuck, fixing errors, finding solutions is nowhere compared to those tutorials. It's not about how much you know. It's about how you use whatever you know.

Reading how to code is not enough, building real stuff is the real deal. It doesn't mean I have mastered javascript. But whatever I know, I feel confident about it.


### 1. RandomQuote

![1randomquote.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596007316940/S63esO_5m.png)

RandomQuote is a simple random programming quotes generator. This was the first thing I built while learning javascript. I learned some basics of Js and I wanted to implement everything I learned. This simple project helped me understand concepts like strings, arrays, functions, event listeners, and template literals in JavaScript. 

What I did was really simple. I stored a few quotes in an array, generated a random number, and then displayed a random quote every time the user clicks a button. But for me, being able to do something like that was magic. I wrote a blog explaining how you can make yours too. See [here](https://blog.rutikwankhade.dev/learn-javascript-concepts-by-building-a-random-quote-generator-ck87070ks00lw9ls1elshm606).                                                                 
 

**User Stories** :
- The user gets a random programming quote on every click.

** Demo :** [randomquot.now.sh](https://randomquot.now.sh)

### 2. NotesWall

![2noteswall.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596007073705/oX5EAyp0v.png)
NotesWall is a simple sticky note app. Rather than making an another todo app, I thought of making this notetaking app. Building this project was super fun and exciting. I made the design minimal and appealing. 

The <input> element of type color provides a user interface element that lets a user specify a color, either by using a visual color picker interface or by entering the color into a text field in #rrggbb hexadecimal format.

This way I made it possible for users to choose different colors for their notes.

**User stories :**
- The user can add a short note. 
- For every note, the user can choose a different color.
- Users can delete a note.

**Demo :** [noteswall.now.sh](https://noteswall.now.sh)

Finman is a finance manager to manage all your income and expenses. 



**User stories:**
- The user can add income or expenses.
- For every income/expense, the user has to add amount and description.
- The user gets the total income, expense, and balance amount.
- The user can delete income/expense.

**Demo :** [finman.now.sh](https://finman.now.sh)

### 5. Apihouse

Apihouse is an interface for the [public-apis](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) repository where you can get a collective list of free APIs for use in software and web development. This repository was so big and full of APIs and it was really difficult to find APIs in the whole readme file. But surprisingly it had its own API too. So to make my life a little easy and better I made this app for myself.  If you are curious to know what happens when the frontend devs meet free APIs, read my blog [here](https://blog.rutikwankhade.dev/when-frontend-devs-meet-free-apis-ckbuntmsn0005eys15p707des).



**User stories:**
- The user gets a list of public APIs based on the category chosen.

**Improving user experience:**

If you are displaying more than 10-15 cards or lists, having a top button ( to go on the top) will surely improve the user experience.

## Final thoughts:


> 
**Don't stop because someone has already done it. You'll (probably) never come up with anything unique, but you can always create something better.**

See the soul purpose of building stuff to learn.  you will not write the clean code for the first time. It will be always a mess. But eventually when you
