## Week 1: Documenting the learning process


I looked at my GitHub contribution-graph Today, it's almost a year now since I started my coding journey. What a coincidence!

I was a complete beginner. I knew nothing. The communities played a big part in helping me figure out what to learn. Throughout the year I kept learning and pushing the code. To be honest those green dots were so addictive that I used to try so hard to maintain the streak. Now I know how harmful it can be.

I know. It's not the best way to measure someone's work. But looking back, I can see my progress, what mistakes I did and the lessons I learned.
Though I don't care much about the stats anymore. 

## A fresh start
I am more into the process now. And the best way to track my progress is to document the process. I know some tech, made a few projects too but now **it's time to start afresh**. 

#### So what's the motivation?

- For a long time I felt like I am not utilizing my full potential. I believe I can do a lot more and that pushed me to make a move.
- I finished reading **"Deep Work"** by Cal Newport. And I want to implement it and make a difference in my professional life.
- Recently I have become a part of a mentorship program called **FullStackCamp** by [Deepak Kumar](https://twitter.com/HQdeepak) which will help me learn and apply more.
- I will be graduating in 2021 and I want to be ready to face the real world.   

## The challenge

So I am taking *the challenge of writing a blog every week for the next 12 weeks*. I will write about the things I learned throughout the week, the resources I used, the ups and downs, and the whole process of learning. I will document everything. 

I know committing to something is super easy. Execution is what makes the difference. I am well aware of all the challenges I have to face and the sacrifices I have to make. It won't be easy. But I will give my best.

 
## ðŸ“… The first week

The first week was all about brushing up on my fundamental skills.
- I read about HTML and CSS and got to know some new stuff that I didn't know earlier. 
- Created a simple portfolio site and practiced on the Freecodecamp's curriculum.
- Learned git concepts in deep and started using emojis in my git commit messages. It's cool you know. You can follow [Gitmoji's](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) guide or you can follow this simple guide [emoji-log](https://github.com/ahmadawais/Emoji-Log/) for commit messages.

Also, I love watching talks, whether it's a ted talk or some other tech conference I enjoy watching them. So to make this journey more interesting I will be sharing my favorite talk every week here. Maybe an insightful Twitter thread too and many more.

So this is exciting and fun. Let's see how it goes. `
