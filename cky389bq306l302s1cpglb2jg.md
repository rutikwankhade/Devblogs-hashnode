## DevFest19: My experience of attending Devfest Pune 2019

## How it started?

It was the month of August, just a rational day of my life. And I was reading about the programs that google organize to help and grow the community of developers across the globe. I was reading about DSC, GDE, and GDGs. And I got to know about [GDG Pune](https://wtm-oss.github.io/home/). So I researched more and learned that these Google Developer Groups organize meetups and events for students and professionals in and around Pune. Basically its like a community of like-minded people who come together to share and explore google technologies and their experiences. 

After a few weeks, I read a tweet from GDGpune about DevFest19 which is the largest google related event that happens every year. So I registered for it. Around 5k-6k people registered for the event and only 1000 people got the invitations. Luckily I was one of them.

I was attending this kind of event for the first time in my life. As most of the students including myself weren’t aware of such events and activities. The event was scheduled from 8 am to 6 pm at JW Marriott hotel in Pune. I reached on time. The first hour was all about registrations and networking. I met so many awesome people out there. I got to interact with them and discuss various aspects of a developer’s journey. The place was surrounded by ignited minds and that turned the whole atmosphere into an exciting and enthusiastic place.

And the event started with an inspiring talk “Old monk in a new era” by Mr. **Rahul Narvekar** (CEO of sun and sand advisers). Listening to his childhood stories and how his reading habits and interest helped him make his career was so inspiring for the young generation. He talked about how he started his career at an early age, as a door to door salesman to support his education. After being expelled from his entrepreneurship program for *asking too many questions* and *being a trouble maker*, he started and failed in so many businesses. 

The one thing I loved which he learned throughout his journey and asked everyone to be was _‘Be Besharam’_. And do whatever you want to do. He talked about how people with you spend most of your time affects your life. You have to cut those people and be around people who support you, encourages you.

Then [**Sandeep Gupta**](https://twitter.com/thesandeepgupta?lang=en), Product Manager for TensorFlow at Google talked about machine learning with TensorFlow. He demonstrated a live module of machine learning on TensorFlow and explained how ML can change the way we see technology. Also, he shared some resources to kick start your journey with machine learning. The fun part was where he shows a demonstration of a teachable machine. That encouraged me to try ML now.

And then comes [**Bruce Schwack**](https://twitter.com/schwackattack77), Co-founder of [Netmeds](https://www.netmeds.com). The man with the coolest entry on stage. I enjoyed his talk most. He is a very funny and energetic guy. He talked about how his startup and business ideas with Pradeep Dadha, Founder of Netmeds made him stay in India for the last 11 years.

From his experiences and stories, he talked about the customer experience and why it is more important than anything else. From clicking a random selfie with MS Dhoni just to check the camera quality to MS Dhoni being the Brand ambassador of _Netmeds_, his story was so inspiring. His talk was full of stories and funny incidents. Two things to take from Bruce are first to Know your value and demand it and second Say so what? more often.

We are approaching a real physical barrier for technological progress and to solve this quantum computing can be used.

Speaking out what you want, is significantly faster than navigating buttons and menus and filters. This idea is revolutionary.
