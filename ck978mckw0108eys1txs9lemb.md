## Different ways of defining functions in JavaScript

Functions are one of the basic concepts in programming. The name itself suggests, it performs a function. A function is a block of code that you can use whenever you need and wherever you required to avoid repeated code blocks. Once a function is written, it can be used over and over and over again. They usually take some input, perform some operations on it and produce some output.  

In JavaScript there are several ways of defining functions. We will see them one by one.

## The function declaration 
Functions are defined, or declared, with the **function **keyword. The declaration begins with the function keyword, followed by the name of the function then set of parentheses, which can be used for optional parameters. The code of the function is contained in curly braces.

```javascript
function nameOfFunction() {
    // Code to be executed
}
```
Functions allow a programmer to divide a big program into a number of small and manageable functions.
For example, If you are building a simple calculator then sum() will be a function. It will take two or more integers as input and return the sum as the result. 

```javascript
//function declaration
function sum(a,b){
return a+b;
}
```
  ### ðŸ“Œ Calling Functions
Defining a function does not execute it. Defining it simply names the function and specifies what to do when the function is called. Calling the function actually performs the specified actions with the indicated parameters. 

```javascript
//function call
sum(5,3);
//output : 8
```
### ðŸ“Œ Function Parameters 
Parameters are input that gets passed into functions as names and behave as local variables. A function can have multiple parameters or no parameters at all.

### ðŸ“Œ Function arguments
The argument is the actual value that gets passed into the function.

In function sum() a and b are parameters whereas 5 and 3 are arguments.

### ðŸ“Œ The return Statement
A JavaScript function can have an optional return statement. This is required if you want to return a value from a function. This statement should be the last statement in a function.

## The function expression 
A function expression looks similar to function declarations, except that the function is assigned to a variable name. 
```javascript
var sum=function(a,b){
return a+b;
};

sum(5,3);
//output : 8
```


Functions stored in variables do not need function names. They are always invoked (called) using the variable name. The function above ends with a semicolon because it is a part of an executable statement.

### ðŸ“Œ Difference between function declaration and function expression
> 
Function declarations are hoisted but function expressions are not. 

Functions defined in a function declaration are hoisted, which means that you can use the function although it's defined below the code using it. Hoisted functions are made available everywhere within the current scope. For example

```javascript
//function is invoked before declaration
sum(5,3);  //output : 8
//function declaration
function sum(a,b){
return a+b;
}

```
As opposed to function declarations, function expressions are not hoisted and can therefore not be used before they're defined. 
```javascript
sum(5,3);  //output :  // TypeError: sum is not a function
//function expression
var sum =function(a,b){
return a+b;
}
```
## IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)
Functions that are executed as soon as they are declared, these functions are known as Immediately Invoked Function Expressions or IIFEs. 
IIFEs follows a particular syntax as shown below.
```javascript
(function (){ 
// code to be executed
})();
```
Let's break it down to make more sense. We basically have a function defined inside parentheses, and then we append () to execute that function.
```javascript
( /*function*/ )();
```
The function becomes a function expression that is immediately executed. 
Here are few important things about IIFEs

- The variable within the expression can not be accessed from outside it. 
- IIFEs are very useful because they donâ€™t pollute the global object, and they are a simple way to isolate variables declarations.
- While creating a bunch of variables and functions in the global scope that no one uses outside your code, just wrap all of that in an IIFE and Your code will continue to work, but now you are not polluting the global scope. 
- IIFE is useful while implementing [Module Pattern](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#modulepatternjavascript) in JavaScript. 

## Arrow Functions
 Arrow functions are mainly syntactic sugar for defining function expressions. Arrow function allows us to write functions in a much shorter syntax. Itâ€™s one of the most popular features of ES6. We can now create more concise, cleaner, and more readable functions by using the **=>** operator. 
The syntax is as follows
```javascript
()=>{ /*code to be executed*/ }
```
Syntax wise itâ€™s easier to understand, remove the function keyword, declare the function like a variable, and after arguments, put a fat arrow.
```javascript
// Regular function
function sum(a,b){
return a+b;
}

//Arrow Function
var sum=(a,b)=>{ return a+b;}
```
Even though arrow functions are more concise than normal functions, they can still be reduced.
If the function body has a single expression, it can be written as
```javascript
var sum =(a,b)=> return a+b;   //removed curly braces
```
Also if there is only one parameter, then there is no need for parenthesis. For example, consider a function that takes a number as input and returns its square as a result.
```javascript
const square = a =>return a*a;    //removed parenthesis
const square = a => a*a; 
// In this case, we can also omit return keyword.
```
The primary use case of arrow functions is for functions that get applied over and over again to items in a list. For example, if you have an array of values that you want to transform using a [map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map), an arrow function is ideal.
```javascript
const digits= [2,3,4,5,6];
const square = digits.map(num => num*num);

console.log(digits);
// output : [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
console.log(square);
// output : [4, 9, 16, 25, 36]
```
Important points about arrow functions
- Just like function expressions, arrow functions aren't hoisted â€” only function declarations are. 
- Arrow functions cannot be named.
- Arrow functions lexically bind the current **this **value. That means  The treatment of this within an arrow function is different than within non-arrow function expressions.

## Conclusion
The decision of which declaration type to choose depends on the situation. There are a few more ways that aren't discussed in this article. But I hope you got a little idea about different ways we can define functions.
